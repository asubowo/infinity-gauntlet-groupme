Wield the mighty power of the Infinity Gauntlet and become the almighty Thanos himself!

This is a GroupMe bot that bans approximately half of a GroupMe on your behalf. Use with caution.
I am not responsible for whatever chaos you bring upon on your group. It is best to deploy to your Heroku instance.

1) Ensure you are the admin of your group
2) Deploy this to your Heroku instance, and add the appropriate environment variables to your instance vars.
3) Sit back, and run '/snap'. Keep in mind that anyone can call this command at any time. Yes, the code is /that/ lazy. But this was only created as a primer and introduction to JS.
